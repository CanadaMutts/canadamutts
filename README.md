# Canada Mutts – Canadian Dog Lifestyle Blog

Canada Mutts is a growing Canadian dog lifestyle blog covering dog parks, walking trails, pet services, and dog-friendly spaces across major Canadian cities. Our goal is to help dog owners discover local adventures, trusted products, and practical resources for life with their dogs in communities across Canada.

This project began as a small idea under the name *Southern Ontario Dogs*, but we rebuilt it with a clearer vision and national focus. We purchased the CanadaMutts.ca domain, invested in hosting, and committed to creating a long-term platform for Canadian dog lovers.
