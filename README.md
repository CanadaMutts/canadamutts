# Canada Mutts – Canadian Dog Lifestyle Blog

🌐 Visit our website: **https://canadamutts.ca**

Canada Mutts is a Canadian dog lifestyle blog covering dog parks, walking trails, pet services, and dog-friendly spaces across major Canadian cities. Our goal is to help dog owners discover local adventures, trusted products, and practical resources for life with their dogs in Canadian communities.

This project began as a small idea under the name *Southern Ontario Dogs*, but we rebuilt it with a clearer vision and national scope. We bought the domain, invested in hosting, and launched CanadaMutts.ca to create a growing platform for Canadian dog lovers.
